<a name=4></a>Problem 4

Do a Storm Nemo snow shovel simulation.

During Storm Nemo, Karel the Robot was watching Lee solve the problem of
where to put the snow. The only way to get rid of it was to shovel a
swath and pile it up. Then shovel another swath and pile it in another
pile. These piles would then be moved onto Lee's lawn. The piles could
only be four feet high. Here's what the piles looked like after one day
of shoveling.

Put the 4 beepers that are nearest Karel in a pile at location
(avenue,street) = (4,8).  Put the remaining beepers in a pile at
location (4,7). Move the pile you 1st built to some place on the lawn
and move the 2nd pile to another place on the lawn.  The p, q, r and
lawn are just there to help you locate key places.
