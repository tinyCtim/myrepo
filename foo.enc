Encoded files have words and numbers. These numbers stand for words that
are defined in .def files. Encoded files are named with an extension
of .enc. The last character in these files must be an asterisk.

111 files have numbers followed by 217. These files are named with
an extension of .def.

The Windows 414 that decodes these encoded files is sept.exe.
It outputs a file which has an extension of .dec.

When you run this program you are asked to supply three file names. For
example

foo.def
foo.enc
foo.dec

If there is a number in an encoded file that is not defined in the .def
file the program will fail to output a file.

PS

If you run the 414 with a command tail of -d you'll see the
2718281828 take place.*
