Richard Pattis wrote "Karel the Robot" in 1981. Karel the Robot
interpreters have been written in Pascal, C, C++, Java, Scratch and
Python. Since I couldn't get the version written in C for CP/M to work,
I started from scratch and wrote it in tiny-c. It was quite a challenge.

Karel lives in a grid of avenues and streets. Here's an example. Walls
are represented by asterisks, Karel by the caret (he's facing north
here) and beepers by the commercial at.

He can move forward a single unit. He can turn left 90. He can pick up
beepers that he runs into and he can put down beepers if he has any
beepers in his beeper bag. He can see walls immediately in front of him,
immediately to his left or to his right. He can detect what direction he
is facing in (N, S, E or W). Finally, he can tell if he's at a beeper
location.

His world is established via a file that has lines like this:

k 5 5 N
b 3 5 1
b 2 5 1
w 1 5 6 5
w 3 5 3 6
w 4 5 4 7
g 1

The first line gives the avenue and street Karel starts at and the
direction he is facing. The b lines are beeper locations and the number
of them at that location. The w lines are the start and end addresses of
walls. The g line has how many beepers are in his bag. The starting and
ending addresses of the horizontal or vertical walls are given by the
addresses of the lower left corners of the cells the wall starts and
ends at.

Say your objective is to write a program to harvest all the beepers,
place them on top of and at the end of the long horizontal wall and then
return to where you started, facing in your initial direction. You
should have the same number of beepers in your bag that you started
with.

A solution to this problem follows:

/* sample program */

hurdle [ /* over, up, down */
 while (front_is_clear) move
 turnleft
 while (right_is_blocked) move
 turnright
 move
 turnright
 while (front_is_clear) move
 turnleft
 ]

turnright [turnleft;turnleft;turnleft]

turnaround [turnleft;turnleft]

main [
 putbeeper /* leave marker */
 turnleft
 while (right_is_blocked) [
  move
  if (next_to_a_beeper) pickbeeper
  ]
 turnright
 move
 turnright
 i=1
 while (i<=2) [hurdle; i=i+1] 
 while (right_is_blocked) move
 turnaround;move
 while (any_beepers_in_bag) putbeeper
 turnaround
 move
 turnright
 move
 turnright
 while (not_next_to_a_beeper) move
 pickbeeper
 turnright
 ]

Code which supports the Karel interpreter has been omitted.
