Good books are usually more complex and more interesting than good
computer programs. Of course they are essentially not comparable so the
claim I've just made is of questionable value.

<b>But there is a relationship between all things.</b>

And I've found comparing things often gives meaning to us. The image
above is my latest paper puzzle. I sent it to one of my "reader" friends
who enjoys sharing with me math quotes he finds in books. The mouse in
this 17-pieces puzzle is a reader. 17 is prime. I sent him a quote from
Adam Bede (<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Bede>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Bede</a>) by George Eliot and
he replied with one from a book he's reading. Here they are:

"My" quote from "Adam Bede" by George Eliot:

'But,' said Adam, 'I've seen pretty clear, ever since I was a young un,
as religion's something else besides notions. It isn't notions sets
people doing the right thing _ it's feelings. It's the same with the
notions in religion as it is with math'matics, _ a man may be able to
work problems straight off in's head as he sits by the fire and smokes
his pipe; but if he has to make a machine or a building, he must have a
will and a resolution and love something else better than his own ease.'

Here's "his":

(He starts ...)

I had never heard of Adam Bede or the author. What a great find. I
particularly liked the math quote you sent me. I'm going to save that
one. Here is a quote for you.

1Q84 math quote

"Math is like water. It has a lot of difficult theories, of course, but
its basic logic is very simple. Just as water flows from high to low
over the shortest possible distance, figures can only flow in one
direction. You just have to keep your eye on them for the route to
reveal itself. That's all it takes. You don't have to do a thing. Just
concentrate your attention and keep your eyes open, and the figures make
everything clear to you. In this whole, wide world, the only thing that
treats me so kindly is math."

(He continues)

This quote is from Tengo the second main character in the book. He is a
writer and teaches math at a cram school in Japan. The book is over 1000
pages. It is by my favorite author, Haruki Murakami. I enjoyed it so
much I am now listening to it on audible. Love it even more the second
time around.
