A key decision I made after trying other approaches was to drive my
logic by keeping a close eye on a global variable gp<a

This was declared up top as follows:

	char *gp;

gp is a "pointer" to a place in memory that holds a value that is a
character.

We read a text file into an array which we declare

	char buffer[10000];

We initialize gp like so:

	gp=buffer;

An array's name is a pointer to the first slot in the 10000 slots
allocated.

One of the things I had to do was figure out how I could get to the
first relevant byte in my data file. That would be the first digit of
the number 18.

Millie

leg (mibs covered),time (tibs on watch at end of leg)

1,18
2,48
3,58
4,61
5,66

I wrote a function called find_char which took a character argument and
returned either a 1 or a 0.

int find_char(char c) {
 while (*gp!=c) {
  ++gp;
  if (gp==end) return 0;
  }
  return 1;
 }

Putting an asterisk in front of gp gives you the value of the character
that gp is pointing at.

There are various ways you can decide to go about this but since I knew
once I got to my 18 I would then simply need to look for the next comma,
the next comma etc. I decided to code

// get past the text that precedes the data
 find_char(right_paren);++gp;
 find_char(right_paren);++gp;

and then code

 while (1) {
  if (find_char(',')==0) break;
  ++gp;

  etc. etc.
  
 }
 
The find_char function advances the pointer while it's not pointing at
the sought for character. The above ++gp gets past the found character.
So we scoot past the two right parentheses and then past the comma that
is in

1,18

So now we're looking at the high order digit in the 18.

After dealing with the 18 we look for the next comma, bump gp up by 1
and are now able to process the 48. etc. etc.

The

  if (find_char(',')==0) break;
  
is the way we break out of the main loop of the program. Looking again
at the definition of the function find_char we see that it returns 0
when

	gp==end

Now end is established at an early stage of the program to point at the
last byte of the data file.

After we've got gp to point at the high order digit we use our find_char
function to locate the newline character at the end of line and then
have enough information to convert the character string holding the
entire number to an integer (this is what atoi does), and store it in a
slot in the array called

 int accum_time[200];

The rest of the program does some comparing of the values of pace

  pace=accum_time[j+1]-accum_time[j];

as j cycles from 0 to i-2 (where i is 13 for a 13 "mib" run) to
determine which leg was the fastest (smallest value of pace) and which
was the slowest (biggest value of pace).

The overall average pace is

 average_whole=accum_time[i-1];
 printf("%c%cAverage pace was %3.1f",10,10,(float)average_whole/i);
