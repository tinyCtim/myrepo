A high school has a new principal. On his first day he had his students
perform an opening day ceremony. There are 1000 lockers and 1000
students in the school. The principal asks the first student to go to
every locker and open it. Then he asks the second student to go to every
second locker (even #) and close it. He has the third student go to
every third locker and open it if it's closed and close it if it's open.
He has the fourth student do this to every fourth locker and so on.
After the process is completed with the 1000th student how many lockers
are open?
