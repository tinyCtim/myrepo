Tree files are 8712 bytes long because ...

at the beginning of the tree are 2 4-byte slots for the record numbers
of the first and last record and 2*4 = 8

there are 128 4-byte available slots and 4*128 = 512

there are 64 bytes in each record and 128 records and 64*128 = 8192

8 + 512 + 8192 = 8712
