Bobby Bannister wants to run a 4:10 marathon (4 hour 10 minute). He's read that one
approach is to run a flat pace which would be 9:33 minutes per mile.
Another approach is to run the first 10 slower and arrive at mile 11 one
minute behind schedule, that would mean at a 9:39 pace. At what pace
would Bobby need to run the remainder of the race in order to meet his
goal?

This can be done with pencil and paper and some algebra. You don't need
a computer program. But ... it would be nice to give Bobby a pace chart
like

  1      0 : 9 : 39
  2      0 : 19 : 18
  3      0 : 28 : 57

etc.
