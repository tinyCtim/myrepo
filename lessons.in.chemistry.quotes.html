In place of a conventional review, this is a collection of quotes from
the story. The [nnn] are page numbers.

[27] ... and then they gathered their cups and saucers and went off in
opposite directions, each desperately hoping the other didn't mean it.
(Zott / Calvin)

[31] ... their first kiss cementing a permanent bond that even chemistry
could not explain.

[32] If relationships are a puzzle, then theirs was solved from the get
go - as if someone shook out the box and watched from above as each
separate piece landed exactly right, slipping one into the other, fully
interlocked, into a picture that made perfect sense. They made other
couples sick.

[91] He was dead thirty-seven minutes later. (Calvin)

[107] Frask: "Evans left you something" (abiogenesis)

[110] "Zott? But Mr. Zott works here!" (E. Zott)

Ch 18 Harriet Sloane introduced

Dr. Moran, on rowing, recruits Elizabeth

[171] "That's my point," Harriet said. "Of all disciplines, shouldn't
science be able to weed out its own intellectual zeroes? Wasn't that
Darwin's deal? That the weak eventually bite the dust?" But she could
tell Elizabeth wasn't listening.

[172] "Second time's the charm," Elizabeth insisted. <i>Off by one</i>,
thought Six-Thirty.

Ch 21 E.Z. - Frask looked back, shocked. "Same," she said limply [178]

Ch 22 The Present 

"Do we care?" [181]

Walter Pine - TV slot - (Amanda is his daughter) 

Because it was hers [183] (Donatti)

Still, if she had to choose between Amanda Pine, lunch thief, and
Madeline Zott, inappropriate question asker, she'd (Mudford) take Amanda
any day.

Pine tries to sell Supper at Six.

[201] Lebensmal

[219] CH<sub>3</sub>COOH - Vinegar

[227] Three bites later, Amanda declared it to be the best thing she'd
ever eaten.

Ch 27 All About Me - May 1960 [233]

[246] "I'm Reverend Wakely," he whispered, nodding an apology to the
frowning librarian. "From First Presbyterian."

"Mad Zott." Madeline said. "Mad - like your magazine."

[247] ... so he could refute it.

[248] "Religion," he said. Then he got up and left (Evans's response)

What did Wakely whisper to Mad? (We later learn: "I don't believe in
God.")

<i>Switzerland</i>, she wrote. <i>Move.</i> (Bonding)

"It's chicken pot pie night," she announced. "Let's get started."

[256] "What was <i>that?</i>" Walter gasped. "What did she say?"

"Subsidized childcare," Rosa said as she sponged his forehead. "We
should get that on the ballot." She leaned down, taking in a vein
pulsing on Walter's forehead. "Listen, why don't I get you some
acetylsalycylic acid. I'll -"

"What did <i>you</i> say?" he hissed, batting her sponge away.

"Subsidized childcare."

"No, the other -"

"Acetylsalycylic acid?"

"<i>Aspirin</i>, he demanded hoarsely. "We at KCTV, we call it
<i>aspirin</i>. Bayer aspirin."

"Dr. Fillis, heart surgeon," and the clapping became thunderous. [260]

"Boys, set the table," Elizabeth commanded. "Your mother needs a moment
to herself." [261]

[269] <i>Amanita phalloides</i> It's fair to say noone in California
touched their dinner that night. (poisonous mushrooms)

"Zott," Rosa, the makeup woman, said on her way out. "Lebensmal wants to
see you at seven." ... "By the way, I loved tonight's show. It was
funny."

Elizabeth looked up, her eyebrows raised. "Funny?" [270]

[275] He'd fainted dead away (Phil Lebensmal)

It was a heart attack. Not a massive one, ...

[280] "No, Walter," she said slowly. "We're <i>not</i> fired. We're in
charge."

   MAY YOU NEVER RECOVER

He would start with himself.

Ch 32 Get Well Card

[292]

"Children, set the table. ..." (this after atheist comment)

Ch 33 Faith

"Agreed," ... "Yahtzee is fun." [294]

[297] "Wakely," she said. "Everybody lies." (she is Madeline)

Ch 34 All Saints

"But you realize," she said carefully, as if not to embarrass him
further, "faith isn't based on religion. Right?"

[312] The scent of high carbon steel wire was unmistakable (on
Six-Thirty's ability to find a needle in a haystack)

Say what you want about the human race, their capacity for kindness was
what - in Six-Thirty's opinion - put them over the top, species-wise.

Watch Your Parent At Work Day

someone found a small bomb in a ladies hadbag over at KCTV studios

[318] she's a diehard McCarthyist - godless Communist - ... but even
Walter could see: the mutt was crushed

Ch 36 Life and Death

"<i>Life</i> magazine called today."

(Walter and Harriet are becoming a couple!) [322]

[323] During one of the advertising breaks he (Roth) turned to the woman
next to him. "If you don't mind my asking," he asked politely, showing
his credentials, "what is it you like about the show?"

"Being taken seriously."

"Not the recipes?"

She looked back incredulously. "Sometimes I think," she said slowly,
"that if a man were to spend a day being a woman in America, he wouldn't
make it past noon."

[324] "Zott says wait here," she said. (to Roth)

"They're cinnamaldehyde," she explained.

"It's not his work I'm interested in," Roth said. "I wanted to know about
your relationship with Evans."

"How is that your business?"

Again, he felt the weight of the dog's eyes on him. 

<i>I have mapped and memorized the location of your carotid artery.</i>

Roth reports.

She told him her story.

           Sold Out

Ch 38 Brownies - July 1961

[337] (Note to Elizabeth from Roth) Sorry, Zott. Quit Life. Still trying
to get the truth out, not that anybody wants it. Been rejected etc.

[344] Wakely's typist is Miss Frask! 216 wpm

"Evans?" They looked at each other in equal astonishment (Frask to Mad)
[347]	

[349] "Holy hell," she fumed (as she read Roth's latest)
"Zott is the real deal."
It appeared in the next issue.

[355] "Wakely," she said. "He didn't know how to swim either." (Elizabeth
to Wakely on her brother's attempt to save her.)

[356] "It's that you want back <i>in</i>. (Wakely to Elizabeth)

            CHEMISTRY IS CHANGE
[360]

Class dismissed.

Vogue gets Roth's followup

[366] "Why Their Minds Matter"

Avery Parker and Wilson show up

"Sorry Donatti," she said, handing him a pen.
"You're just not smart enough." [370]

Avery is Calvin's mother!
