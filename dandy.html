<a href=http://primepuzzle.com/not.just.tiny.c/dandy.html>Dandelion</a>
wanted to make wine when he noticed a bunch of yellow flowers in his
front yard.

<p>

He'd studied the distribution of these flowers and knew that the
probability you'd find x flowers per square foot was

<p>

<p>

where the average number of flowers per square foot is &lambda;.

<p>

e = 2.71828 and x! ("factorial") means x(x-1)(x-2) ... 1.

<p>

He made a 1x1 square foot frame and placed it in different spots on the
yard and picked the flowers inside the frame. He did this 20 times.

<p>

&lambda; was 5 flowers per square foot.

<p>

Simulate this situation by generating 20 random integers x using the
formula above.

<p>

You can limit the x values to be between 0 and 17.

<p>

The average number of flowers picked can be shown to be 5 times 20 which
is 100. How many dandelions did Dandelion pick in your simulation?
