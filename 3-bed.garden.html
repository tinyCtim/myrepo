Here's a recent problem worked on in an Elementary Algebra session:

You have 58' of fencing material and you want to create a 3-bed garden
that looks like so:

  |--------|--------|--------|
  |        |        |        |
  |        |        |        |
  |        |        |        |
  |--------|--------|--------|

The length is 12' more than twice the width. The total area of the
garden needs to be at least 100 sq. feet. Question: Is there enough
fencing material to do it? Explain your answer by defining appropriate
variables, writing down equations and / or inequalities and solving.
