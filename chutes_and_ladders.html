This program implements a single-player version of chutes and ladders.
The game board is a 10 x 10 grid of squares numbered one through 100.
The game is played by moving a token from square to square according to
the throw of a die. The player starts with a token in the the imaginary
space left of square 1 (lower left) and then rolls a single die to move
the token by the number of squares indicated by the die roll following
the route marked on the gameboard. The route is from the bottom to the
top of the playing area, passing once through every square. If a move
puts the token on the lower-numbered end of squares connected by a
ladder, move the token up to the higher-numbered square. If a move lands
on the higher-numbered square of a pair connected by a chute, move the
token down to the lower-numbered square. The player must roll the exact
number to reach the final square to win the game. If a number is rolled
that would take the player beyond the final square, the player remains
on their current square. For a history of the game see the Wikipedia
article:

Details: Even though the board is 2D in conception, you can represent it
as a 1D array of 101 cells (cell 0 is not used). The location of the
user’s token is contained in a variable. No token needs to be put in the
1D array. Each cell of the array contains either 0 (which means it is an
ordinary square) or an integer (which means that the square is the start
of a chute or of a ladder). If the player lands on a square containing
an integer, the player’s location is changed to that integer. For
example, say the player is on square 13 and rolls a 3. This moves the
player to square 16, which is the beginning of a chute. The array
contains a 6 in cell 16, so the player’s location is changed to 6. A
ladder is when a cell contains an integer greater than the index of the
cell (e.g. cell 80 contains a 100). A chute is when a cell contains an
integer less than the index of the cell (e.g. cell 16 contains a 6).
After each roll the results are printed out and the game pauses so the
player can see what happened. Then the player hits return and the next
roll is done. At the end of play, print out the number of moves it took
to reach the goal. To play a multi-player version of the game, each
player starts a single player game in a separate DOS window.

Sample run:

Roll: 2
You advance to square 2
Roll: 1
You advance to square 3
Roll: 4
You advance to square 7
Roll: 5
You advance to square 12
Roll: 3
You advance to square 15
Roll: 6
You advance to square 21
Great! You landed on a ladder at 21 and climb to square 42
Roll: 4
You advance to square 46
Roll: 1
You advance to square 47
Oh No! You landed on a chute at 47 and slide to square 26
Roll: 6
You advance to square 32

...

Roll: 1
You advance to square 92
Roll: 5
You advance to square 97
Roll: 2
You advance to square 99
Roll: 1
You advance to square 100

You reached the goal in 95 moves!
