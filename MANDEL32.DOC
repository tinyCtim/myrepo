                      Documentation for MANDEL32

MANDEL32 generates Mandelbrot set images. These images are printed 
with PLOT (or ZPLOT.) You need an Epson MX80 dot matrix printer with 
GRAFTRAX PLUS to use ZPLOT, as configured. PLOT is fully documented in 
PLOT33.LBR. ZPLOT is documented in ZPLOT10.LBR. ZPLOT is a Z System 
aware version of PLOT. You will need to obtain one of these libraries 
to fully understand how PLOT works (and to prepare a version of PLOT 
that will work with your dot matrix printer.)

                          The Mandelbrot Set

The Mandelbrot set was discovered by Benoit Mandelbrot. It is defined 
as follows:

Take any number c in the complex plane. Starting with the complex 
number z at the origin, compute a new complex number z by squaring z 
and adding c to the result.

                             z <- z*z + c

Repeat this; square the new z and add c to the result to obtain a new 
z. Do this again and again ... If the complex numbers z wander off to 
infinity after enough iterations of this process, the number c does 
NOT lie in the Mandelbrot set. Otherwise, the number c lies in the 
Mandelbrot set.

This deceptively simple definition can be implemented by computer 
program using the definition

                             z = x + i*y

where i is the imaginary unit (i*i = -1) and x and y are the real and 
imaginary parts. It can be shown that

                       z*z = x*x - y*y + i*2x*y

(simply multiply it out using the Distributive Law and the fact that 
i*i equals -1.)

                            Using MANDEL32

To run the program, type

   A>MANDEL32 <cr>

You will be asked to supply seven numbers. These numbers establish the 
rectangular section of the Mandelbrot set to be computed, the step 
sizes to use and the maximum number of iterations to use. The 
following table shows a sequence of numbers which "window in" on a 
certain section.

  x1                  x2                y1                 y2
---------           ---------         ---------          ----------               
-2.25               +0.75             -1.5               +1.5
-0.8                -0.7              +0.1               +0.2               
-0.75               -0.74             +0.11              +0.12
-0.745910           -0.744480         +0.111960          +0.113390

The program generates the file MANDEL.VEC. High resolution .VEC files 
can take many hours to compute.

After the MANDEL.VEC file is generated, run ZPLOT (or PLOT) to print 
the image.

   A>ZPLOT MANDEL <cr>

You may send the output to a file instead of a printer by supplying a 
second argument. 

   A>ZPLOT MANDEL MANDEL <cr>
 
will generate the file MANDEL.PLT. This may be printed later with PIP.

   A>PIP LST:=MANDEL.PLT[O] <cr>

MANDEL32 is a significant improvement over MANDEL31.BAS thanks to the 
efforts of Larry Schnitger. Its most important feature is the use of 
the "D" (Draw line) plot command supported by ZPLOT. The size of the 
.VEC file is dramatically reduced by its use. The size and resolution 
of the graphic are now user controlled. The parameters used are 
imbedded in the graphic itself by using the "T" (text) plot command. A 
more efficient loop index is used and a better runtime display is 
given.
