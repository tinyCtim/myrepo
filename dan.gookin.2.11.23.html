This is a review of Dan Gookin's book <i>Tiny C Projects</i><a
style=text-decoration:none href=http://primepuzzle.com/not.just.tiny.c/dan.gookin.2.11.23.html>.</a> I was made aware of the
book by a fellow who is active in a Facebook group I run called not just
Tiny C Programming Group. My friend noted the similarity between the
book's name and the group's name but eventually realized Gookin's Tiny C and
my Tiny C were different. His Tiny C is describing the size of the
projects covered in the book, my Tiny C describes the size of a dialect
of a C-like language.

<p>

C has spawned hundreds of languages which are often written in C. The
Tiny C programming language was written in 8080 assembler in
1977 by Tom Gibson because he wanted to have a C-like language on his
microprocessor-based computer. I bought it and typed in the source
code from the users manual. Tiny C is a learning language, is simpler
than C, and is a stepping stone to C. Later, Gibson implemented his
language in C. Tiny C programs can be fairly easily translated into C.
They can "call" C programs. I will talk about an example of this
shortly.

<p>

<i>Tiny C Projects</i> is published by Manning Publications, Co. They
have something they call MEAP (Manning Early Access Program). They
also support an online "liveBook." It was through these two things that
I got involved. In addition, Gookin maintains a GitHub repository for
his book and proposed solutions to the projects may be downloaded from
it.

<p>

The book was developed incrementally under MEAP and when I bought it,
only the first five chapters or so were finished. Waiting for the
next ones to come out was exciting.

<p>

The author tells you up front that you need to know the basics of C to
follow the projects. I have been learning C for quite a while and have
learned a lot more while doing his projects.

<p>

His book and my group are learn-by-doing undertakings. The first few
chapters teach you how you can get your computer to run a program at
startup and how you can cipher text by shifting the letters up or down
the alphabet.

<pre>
~$ echo "Can you read this?" | ./caesar01
Pna lbh ernq guvf?
</pre>

Woops. I gave it away :-(

<p>

The early chapters taught me how to modify a file called .bash_profile
on my Dell desktop running Window Subsystem for Linux. I use a server to
publish the solutions to exercises discussed in my Facebook group and
the .bash_profile for my account on it currently contains:

<pre>
./greet05 $LOGNAME
./pithy05
alias rot13="tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'"
cd public_html/not.just.tiny.c/
</pre>

<p>

Gookin has been publishing computer books for a long time. He was weaned
on the old PCs and fondly remembers the days of command line
programming. He is comfortable with Linux and Windows and explains just
enough to help you navigate if you are at a DOS terminal or a Linux
terminal. He also has an incredible sense of humor. How many computer
books have you read that make you laugh out loud?

<p>

His projects are fun, interesting and unlike anything you have seen
before. The above is the Linux counterpart to a DOS AUTOEXEC.BAT.
Commands here start with ./ (find the executable by looking in the
current directory). pithy05 is the fifth version of a "fortune" program
he develops. Here's what it might display:

<pre>
Do I take a break from work to play a video game, or take a break from a
video game to get work done?
</pre>

By the time he gets his greet program to version 05 you get something
like:

<pre>
Greetings!
Today is Friday, February 03, 2023
It is 07:15:06 PM
The moon is full
</pre>

You learn how to determine the phase of the moon, announce the time
of day and more. He writes "Here's how I'm going to explain
how the algorithm works: I'm not. Seriously, I have no clue what's going
on. I just copied down the formula from somewhere and &mdash;by
golly&mdash;it works. Mostly."

<p>

Chapters 5 and 6 involve encoding and decoding text and password
generation. One of the key things the author encourages you to do is
take his example programs and extend them to support a new feature.

<p>

For example, after showing you how to encode the string

<pre>
Hello, World!
</pre>

<p>

into hex pairs

<pre>
48 65 6C 6C 6F 2C 20 57 6F 72 6C 64 21
</pre>

he talks about creating what is called a checksum byte which would be
tacked on to the end of the encoded string. (This idea was used in
the early days to reduce errors in data transmission.) 

<p>

In his password chapter a function called scramble is discussed and you are
asked to incorporate its use to make better passwords. I made a
program I was working on better by modifying his scramble function to
fit my needs.

How many simulations do you want (e.g. 100) : 20

 1* 2. 3. 4. 5* 6* 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. 13* 14. 15. 16. 17. 18* 19. 20*

inmates saved : 6 inmates died : 14
</pre>

(What this program does is solve a so-called 100 prisoner problem, which
is interesting in its own right, but I digress.)

<p>

If you're reading this review on a computer and clicked the link above to the C
program, don't feel bad if you are lost trying to understand
the code. Dan explains in his book and on his blog what's going on.
Those "dreaded" pointer variables are at the heart of the scramble function.
It's taken years for me to be able to "see" how they work. Keep studying
C and you'll eventually be fluent. (The link above to the Tiny C program
(file type .tc) shows how you "call" executables via C's system
function.)

<p>

Throughout the book there are examples of things I've never seen before
and also things that I have seen but which are done in a way I didn't know
about. You've probably seen #define macros before but usually they are
just defining constants like PI or MAXIN. Here's a fancier one:

<pre>
#define repeat(a) for (int x = 0; x < a; x++)
</pre>

<p>

He uses it in the add_word() function in randwords01.c.

<pre>
const char *add_word(void)
{
	const char *vocabulary[] = {
		"orange", "grape", ...
	};
	int r;
	
	r = rand() % (sizeof(vocabulary)/sizeof(char *));
	return( vocabulary[r] );
}

int main()
{
	srand( (unsigned)time(NULL] );
	
	repeat(3)
		print("%s ", add_word() );
	putchar('\n');
	
	return(0);
}
</pre>

<p>

I'd never heard of the archive utility ar which is used to
build libraries. In Chapter 7, String utilities, a header file
containing prototypes for functions like 

<pre>char *left(char *s, int len);</pre>

is shown. You first just compile your functions via

<p>

<pre>clang -Wall -c first.c second.c third.c</pre>

<p>

Object files are created by this. You then use ar like so:

<p>

<pre>ar -rcs libmystring.a mystring.o</pre>

Finally, to use the library

<p>

<pre>clang -Wall -L. libsample.c -lmystring</pre> 

I have left a lot of the details out in the above. They are all
explained in the book. I've built libraries before and knew that you
only compiled the functions, created a .h header file and #included it
in your main. But now I know how the pros do it.

<p>

There are five more chapters in the book which I'll let you learn about
on your own. I hope this review has sparked your interest.
