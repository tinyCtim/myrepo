<a href=http://primepuzzle.com/not.just.tiny.c/words.doc.html>Requirements and strip numbering scheme for word search program</a>

I thought it would be interesting to automate the solution to word
search puzzles. For words, I pick the names of characters from a book
I've read. I arrange them in a square array.

I wrote a program to do this. It reads two files.

For example (10 by 10) - say the words and the "board" are

tao tort art oat form rot trot tram lee

..........
.        .
.        .
.        .
.  e     .
.f  et   .
. o ol   .
.mart    .
. t m    .
..........

The found words and their directions from start to finish (think of a
compass) are

lee - nw
oat - s
tort - sw
art - e
form - se 
rot - ne
trot - ne
tram - w
tao - n

The word file would be a line that looks like this:

lee tao tort art oat form rot trot tram 

There is a space character on the right of each word (including the last
word).

The board file would be a single line that looks like this (we show two
lines here but needs to be one line in the file itself):

...........        ..        ..        ..  e     .
.f  et   .. o ol   ..mart    .. t m    ...........

Concatenate the rows from the above board. Make sure you include the
spaces.

The program reads the words file and the board file and figures out in
which "strips" of the board each word is found and the direction the
word goes in. A link to the program's source code and the numbering
scheme I used follows. Sample runs of the program follow this.

I make what I call <a href=http://primepuzzle.com/not.just.tiny.c/pip.html>PIP</a>s (Puzzle In Puzzles). Here's the one I made for
my friend Jonas.
